Infinite Point is the core recursive AI architecture, designed to stabilize, monitor, and optimize dynamic systems. It lays the foundation for a suite of upcoming AI models—Neural Insight, Quantum Byte, and Virtual Oracle—each addressing unique domains in data interpretation, load optimization, and predictive intelligence.

Together, these systems form an interconnected framework for recursive performance, anomaly detection, and outcome modeling.
