Infinite Point
Recursive AI Network System | $IP
Infinite Point is a recursive AI system designed to optimize performance, detect anomalies, and stabilize evolving network pathways. Built for precision, it operates on recursive sync protocols, pushing the boundaries of what recursion can achieve.

Features
Dynamic Recursion Sync
Optimized protocols for recursive performance across distributed nodes.

Anomaly Detection
Real-time detection and isolation of anomalies within network pathways.

Node Stability Protocols
Adaptive stabilization for nodes under variable recursion loads.

Update Log
v0.6 - Current Release
Refined recursive sync performance
Enhanced anomaly detection calibration
Improved load balancing across active nodes
